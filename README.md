Soil Moisture and Climate Monitoring System with Firebase Integration and Web App Monitoring

This project involves the development of a soil moisture and climate monitoring system using an ESP8266 microcontroller, DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, soil moisture sensor, and an OLED display. The system continuously measures the ambient temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, and displays the data on a connected OLED screen.

Key features of the project:

Wi-Fi Connectivity: The ESP8266 connects to a Wi-Fi network to send sensor data to Firebase.
Firebase Real-Time Database: The system uploads temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and relay status data to Firebase in real time, enabling remote monitoring of plant conditions via the Firebase dashboard.
Web App Monitoring: A web app is used to monitor the status of the system in real time, displaying data such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and the relay status.
Soil Moisture Control: A relay is used to control an irrigation system based on soil moisture levels. When moisture levels fall below a predefined threshold, the relay is activated to turn on the irrigation system.
OLED Display: The system displays the current temperature, humidity, and soil moisture levels, along with the relay status on a 128x64 OLED screen.
Threshold-based Automation: The relay is activated or deactivated automatically based on the soil moisture readings to ensure optimal plant care.
This project is ideal for implementing automated irrigation systems and monitoring environmental conditions for plants via Firebase and a web application.
